        <p class="about-me">
            Age: 28 - Pronouns: She/Her<br>Originally from North Sydney, Cape Breton.<br>
            Moved to Halifax in April 2019 to live with my best friend of a decade and partner of 5 years, Patrick. <br><br>
            In my free time I enjoy embroidery, researching geological data, spending time with my significant other,
            and hanging out with our asthmatic orange cat, Louie.<br><br>Other than taking advantage of relaxing at home when I can, I enjoy walking
            along the Bedford waterfront to take in the fresh air and salt water. Two of my favourite bands are Mumford & Sons
             and Peach Pit, but I'll listen to just about anything. Newfie music will always have a special place in my heart.
             We traveled to PEI this July to see Mumford & Sons perform live, and I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat.
             I don't travel much, and have never left the country, but hopefully a change of career and an 
             improved work-life balance will allow us to continue experiencing more of the world. A dream of mine would be to
             travel to Hawaii to visit Mount Kilauea, and Iceland.
            <br><br>After a lot of contemplation over the past couple of years, I decided to return to school for a change of career.
			With the support of many great people in my life, 
            I learned the importance of prioritizing my physical and mental health, and have become an advocate for self-care and safety.
            It's been bittersweet leaving my profession, but I'm motivated and excited to learn new skills and apply them in my
             future career. 
            <br>
            <br>If you can't get a hold of me, I'm probably on FaceTime with my mom.</p>
